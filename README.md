# sp21-cs242-project: mpviz Week 2

## Description

This week, I implemented various algorithms to compute some static information based on users. All the information I computed is available as an API hosted in flask. I then started working on the data visualization.

## Example Execution

- python3 query.py -q '200305518&200696013?ticks'
