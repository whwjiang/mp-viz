# sp21-cs242-project: mpviz Week 1

## Description

This week, I am implementing a scraper to get information from users and routes on Mountain Project, and putting the information I obtain from scraping onto a MongoDB database. The interface is a simple command prompt on main.py. I also implemented some unit testing for scraping and for the database.

## Example Execution

- Scrape user page: 'python3 src/main.py -u https://www.mountainproject.com/user/200305518/william-jiang'

- Scrape route page: 'python3 src/main.py -r https://www.mountainproject.com/route/108312228/comfortably-numb'
